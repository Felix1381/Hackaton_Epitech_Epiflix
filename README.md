#### Epiflix is a web application that allows users to view movie programs and announcements online. The goal of this project was to learn how to retrieve data from the TMDb API and display its content on an interface where users can watch movies. This project helped us deepen our knowledge in using APIs and Vue.js, the framework we used to create our user interface.
